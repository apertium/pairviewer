# pairviewer

An interactive [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) graph of [Apertium language pairs](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/List_of_language_pairs) you can search, filter, and drag around. [Online demo](http://ilazki.thinkgeek.co.uk/~firespeaker/pairviewer/apertium.html).

See the relevant Apertium [wiki page](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Pairviewer) for local setup instructions.

**Features**:
- filter by language pair progress stage, directionality, stem count, creation date, and date of last update
- search by language code
- check language pair name, repository name, creation date, date of last update, and stem amount from individual pairs
- scrape language data from GitHub (requires Python 3)
